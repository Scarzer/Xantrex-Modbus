## Xantrex Modbus Serial Modbus Python Library
This is a python library implementation of the Xantrex modbus specification used for their XW Inverters. 

The code is well commented, and I have not made any dedicated documentation for it, although I might if the need should arise. 

I will add to this a modification I made to the SimplyModbus library for Python to read 32 bit values
